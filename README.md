# Rename Files in Batch

Modify multiple files in a single directory at once, especially when they are from the same source and are named in the same way. 
Useful for renaming multiple files in a folder or directory, making them easier to read. 


The naming is done as follows -  

Initial filename = **Filename_relevant**_(spaces or dots or any character separating the relevant words)_ filename_garbage.**extension** 

Final filename = **Filename_relevant**_(space)_ **dashes_if_required**_(space)_**(definition_if_required)**.**extension**

Words can also be inserted and removed as and when required.
This is very useful while renaming files which might have been copied from Google Drive (using make a copy option) in large numbers, having similar (but not exactly the same) names.

Note -  The app used in the demo video does not have the option of capitalizing a string (it capitalized all the words by default) and selecting if we want to split the string (it assumed that we always need to remove a part of the string to proceed), now both of these have been added as an option.
